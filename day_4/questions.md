## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

A method is used to store frequently used code within another variable, and be able to change the values on a large scale quickly with one swift change.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
def hello()
  puts "Sam I am."
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

```
def hello(name)
  puts "#{name} I am."
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`puts hello("Evette")`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

Since it seems like there would be so many methods used in a simple program, is it advised to keep some sort of dictionary of methods in a readme or elsewhere?
