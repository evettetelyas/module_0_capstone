## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is a scenario that evaluates to true or false.

* If I have enough money, I can buy the shoes.
* If it's raining outside, I will bring an umbrella.
* If I study for more than 10 hours, I will pass the exam.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

You want to use an if statement when you are stating the condition that has to be met. Using an if statement allows you to dictate the output if that condition was met, and also for the situations when it was not.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```
if x > 2
  puts "x is greater than 2"
else
  puts "x is less than or equal to 2"
end
```
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

Using _elsif_ is a way of adding a second condition to an if statement. You can add miltiple _elsif_ statements to a code block to account for any situation.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

```
if x > 2
  puts "x is greater than 2"
elsif x == 2
  puts "x is equal to 2"
else
  puts "x is less than 2"
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

We can use conditional statements to run math in the code. For example, when you put in the grades of a students tests over the semester, you can use a conditional statement to figure out whether or not they passes the class.
