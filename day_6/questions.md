## Day 5 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

A class is the name for a grouping of like objects. They will all behave within _generally_ the same confines and this allows you to plug and play different methods within the class.

1. In relation to a Class, what is an attribute?

An attribute is a property that the entire class shares, but the results would vary. An example would be in a class of dogs, the attribute would be breed. Ypu can have many breeds, but they all have a breed.

1. In relation to a Class, what is behavior?

A behavior is a method. It is something that you use the attributes to manipulate or calculate.

1. In the space below, create a Dog class with at least 2 attributes and 2 behaviors

*Class: Dog*
Attributes: _Breed, Weight, Age_
Behaviors(Methods): _run, eat, bark_

1. How do you create an instance of a class?

`new_instance = Class.new(attribute_values)`

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?
